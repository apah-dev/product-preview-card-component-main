## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

Learnt how to centralize elements without using a flexbox property in the body
Learnt how to use media query to make the site/page responsive across devices
Learnt how to use the import url and the :root to give variables

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:wght@700&display=swap");
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@500;700&display=swap");

:root {
  --cyan: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  --cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
}
```

### Continued development

I intend to understand how to deal with spaces in the body of my page when i want to eliminate such spaces for mobile view to prevent scrolling
